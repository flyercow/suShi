# suShi
Matlab implementation of algorithms to solve sudokus. Just for learning, just for fun. 

## v1.0
Version 1.0 only solves straight sudokus in which speculation is not needed.

## v2.0
Version 2.0 is able to solve sudokus using the Nishio algorithm (http://www.playsudoku.biz/Nishio.aspx). In case of not being able to solve the game in the straight way, it finds boxes where there are two candidates and try both.
